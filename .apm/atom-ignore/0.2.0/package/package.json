With Atom, you can make it globally, or for each project, *via* the `gitignore` file.  \nBut... if you don't want to hide file globally, or ignore them in your repo ?\n\nUse an `.atomignore` file in your projects !\n\nIt works like a regular `.gitignore` file, but only hides the files & folders in your Atom view.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply add an `.atomignore` file in your project.\n\nYou can also control the state of hiding by using `atom-ignore:toggle`, `atom-ignore:enable` & `atom-ignore:disable` commands.\n\n## Keybindings\n\nWith the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I have removed the default keystrokes and let the keymap empty to let you set your own keybindings.\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nThis package monkey patches a key hook built into the default Atom packages TreeView, FuzzyFinder, and Find-and-Replace and for 'Exclude VCS Ignored Paths'. For this package to work, you need to have this option set to true, and there has to be a valid git repo associated with the project that has the `.atomignore` file in it. It doesn't work for random folders that aren't tracked by git (sorry, it was the only hook we could find!)\n\nAtom core **needs** better hooks to allow for useful packages to edit things on a per-project basis. Please support this issue on the following repo trackers:\n- https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues\n- https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues\n- https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues\n\nAll 3 of these packages just needs to provide us a simple project specific config that other packages could set to exclude items. It'll make everyone's life would be a lot easier!\n\n\n\n## Forked from atom-tree-ignore\n\nhttps://github.com/leny/atom-tree-ignore\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jacquescrocker/atom-ignore/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jacquescrocker/atom-ignore#readme","_id":"atom-ignore@0.2.0","_shasum":"f0c9db12b0f8fdfd04de616c098733df779f0eaa","_resolved":"file:../d-117128-54222-5jrgm3/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117128-54222-5jrgm3/package.tgz"}
